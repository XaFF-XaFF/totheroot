          In the ever changing realm of cybersecurity threats, rootkits are a type of malicious software that stands out as particularly sneaky. These covert programs are skilled at infiltrating computer systems and gaining long term control, often targeting the Windows kernel, which is a vital part of the Windows operating system. To truly grasp the extent of their infiltration, it's crucial to understand how rootkits are loaded into the Windows kernel.
        </p>
        <p>
          The process of loading a rootkit into the Windows kernel involves several complex steps;
        </p>
        <h2><span class="heading_dot"></span> Vulnerabilities</h2>
        <p>
          Exploiting Vulnerabilities; Rootkit developers actively search for weaknesses within the Windows operating system, such as flaws in device drivers or unpatched security vulnerabilities. Once they find these weaknesses, they either create or use existing exploits that allow them to execute code with high level privileges in the kernel.

        <h2><span class="heading_dot"></span> Loading</h2>
        <p>
          Installing Kernel Drivers; After successfully exploiting a vulnerability, attackers proceed to install a malicious driver that operates at the same privilege level as the Windows kernel itself. This driver is an integral part of the rootkit and gives it extensive privileges and control over the compromised system.
        </p>
        <h2><span class="heading_dot"></span> Intercepting</h2>
        <p>
          Intercepting Kernel Functions; Rootkits employ various techniques like function hooking to intercept and modify important function calls within the kernel. The manipulation has various objectives, such as concealing the existence of the rootkit, altering system behavior and retaining control over the infiltrated system.
        </p>
        <h2><span class="heading_dot"></span> Persistence</h2>
        <p>
          Methods for Continuity; Rootkits implement mechanisms to ensure their endurance and continued control over compromised systems. This can include actions like adding entries to the registry, setting up scheduled tasks or utilizing other methods to guarantee that their harmful components are loaded every time the system starts up.
