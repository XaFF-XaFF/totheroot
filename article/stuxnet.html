        <h2><span class="heading_dot"></span> Stuxnet</h2>
        <p>
          Stuxnet, the groundbreaking cyber weapon that emerged in 2010 stood out not for its complexity but also for its sophisticated rootkit functionality. The fact that Stuxnet possessed both the characteristics of a cyber weapon and a rootkit showcased its capabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a rootkit Stuxnet had the ability to infiltrate computer systems at a level gaining access, to the core and effectively concealing its presence. This rootkit feature played a role in its success by allowing it to operate undetected while carrying out its mission of disrupting Iranâ€™s nuclear program.
        </p>
        <h2><span class="heading_dot"></span> Capabilities</h2>
        <p>
          With its rootkit capabilities Stuxnet could precisely manipulate industrial control systems and programmable logic controllers (PLCs) all while remaining hidden from detection. This unique combination of rootkit features alongside its objectives as a cyber weapon made Stuxnet an influential example of how malware can compromise systems and even cause physical damage in the real world.
